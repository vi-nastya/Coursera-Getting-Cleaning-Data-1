This repo contains the following files:

- The **run_analysis.R** script that merges the train and test sets, adds descriptive variable names for all the measurements and activities, extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and creates the *tidy_data.txt* file with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- The **codeBook.md** describing all the variables in *tidy_data.txt*. A pdf version of this file is also available

- The resulting dataset is in the **tidy_data.txt** file
